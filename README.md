# Moist Meter üéØ

### Project Description
MoistMeter is a revolutionary AI-powered web application that provides objective, quantitative analysis of memes. It finally settles debates by determining a meme's quality using the highly scientific and completely necessary "Moist Score."

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
For too long, humanity has relied on subjective feelings like "laughter" and "amusement" to judge memes. This leads to chaotic disagreements and a lack of standardized metrics. How can we truly know if a meme is a certified banger or just bone-dry garbage without a number to prove it?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built the MoistMeter, a tool nobody asked for, to solve this non-existent problem. By uploading a meme, users receive a definitive Moist Score calculated with a proprietary (and slightly arbitrary) algorithm, along with extracted text and template analysis. Finally, meme quality is a solved science.

The backend uses sentiment analysis to detect text and rate the meme out of 100

Meme Input: This first block represents the beginning of the process, where a user uploads a meme image through the web interface (index.html).
Feature Extraction: The image is then sent to the backend. This block symbolizes the core analysis where different AI models get to work:
Tesseract reads the text.
The Sentiment Model analyzes the tone of the text.
The CLIP Model identifies the meme's template and confidence.
Scoring Algorithm: The data from the previous step is fed into this block. It represents the Python logic that takes the sentiment score and the template confidence, applies the 60/40 weighting, and calculates the final "Moist Score."
Final Score Display: This last block represents the results being displayed back to the user on the webpage, showing the numerical score, the verdict (e.g., "Certified banger"), and other analytics.
